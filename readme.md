Simple text based Tic Tac Toe in Go

While learning Go, a tutorial on [go.dev](go.dev)'s [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/moretypes/14) printed a tic tac toe board to the console to show examples of slices. This is a super simple text based tic tac toe after learning Go for a few hours. It handles 2 players or allows you to play the computer, but the computer picks randomly in the first iteration.

This was fun, it helped me dig deeper into the details around syntax and datatypes in Go, explore writing my own code in Go and debugging.

Next steps to learn more about Go:

* Better use maps and structures to reference the game settings and the game's state
* Explore using modules or packages better within one repo
* Implement some `AI` besides picking a random spot
* Explore Go's built in test utils
* Have terminal appear to 're-paint game in place'
