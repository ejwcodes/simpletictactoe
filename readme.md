# Simple text based Tic Tac Toe in Go

## What?

A command line util to play tic tac to
To run locally, download the executable or if Go is installed locally download the repository and run `go run .`

The game prompts for one or two players but computer plays by choosing randomly.

## Why?

While learning Go, a tutorial on [go.dev](go.dev)'s [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/moretypes/14) printed a tic tac toe board to the console as part of an examples about slices. I decided to use the tic tac toe to get used to the Go structures and syntax.

### Just scratching the surface

This was fun, it helped me dig deeper into the details around syntax and datatypes in Go, explore writing my own code in Go and debugging.

#### Next steps to learn more about Go:

* Better use maps and structures to reference the game settings and the game's state
* Explore using modules or packages better within one repo
* Implement some computer player logic besides picking a random spot
* Explore Go's built in test utils
* Have terminal appear to 're-paint game in place'
